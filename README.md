# Bahi-Khata Bookkeeping App

Welcome to my simple bookkeeping system! This project is built with Python, Tkinter for the frontend, and MySQL for the backend. It helps you manage accounts, receipts, and payments with a clean, modern interface.

## Features
- Add accounts, receipts, and payments easily
- Responsive, user-friendly Tkinter GUI
- All data stored in a MySQL database
- Modern look with a blurred background image

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and MySQL installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the app:
   ```
   python frontend/app.py
   ```

## Why?
I wanted a simple, beautiful way to manage ledgers and transactions for small businesses or personal use. Hope you find it useful!
